## Feedback and Bug Reports

Please [Create an Issue](https://github.com/yaakapp/app/issues/new) for bug reports and
submit all other feedback to [feedback.yaak.app](https://feedback.yaak.app).

## Contribution Policy

Yaak was initially closed-source, with no plans of ever becoming open
(see [Blog Post](https://yaak.app/blog/why-not-open-source)). However, Open source does
offer many benefits:

- Full transparency over what is happening
- Code can be audited
- Users can help identify and fix bugs

For these reasons, Yaak is now open source but only accepting contributions for bug fixes.
