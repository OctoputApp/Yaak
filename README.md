## Contribution Policy

Yaak was initially closed-source, with no plans of every becoming open
(see [Blog Post](https://yaak.app/blog/why-not-open-source)). However, Open source does
offer many benefits:

- Full transparency over what is happening
- Code can be audited
- Users can help identify and fix bugs

For these reasons, Yaak is now open source but only accepting contributions for bug fixes.
